# Modifiers

### Unrestricted

Any card can be placed in your command zone and played as a commander. Other commander restrictions still apply. 

### Luck of the Draw

Every player chooses a random commander. They must play the most recent deck built on Archidekt / Moxfield with that commander in the command zone.
- Decks must be matched to the bracket chosen for the game.

### Your Turn!

Every player chooses their decks to play without knowledge this modifier will be in play. Each player then rotates their deck counter-clockwise, so the player before them in the turn order has their deck.

### Full House

Instead of taking their turn, a player may instead choose to fill their hand up to seven cards. Their turn is then skipped with no chance to play any phases.
- Effects that increase maximum hand size do not affect this seven card limit.

### Monochrome

All cards are played as if they are completely colourless. CMC is used to determine mana cost.
- Cards outside of the commander's original colour identity are allowed.
- The CMC rule means that a card that was originally 3RRG would now be 6 colourless total.

### Big Brother

All hands and libraries are played face-up. Knowledge of the card order past the next card draw is still restricted.
- This means you cannot look at your second, third, etc cards freely - you still need to scry (or use other means) in order to figure this out.
