# Challenges

### What makes you SPECIAL?

All players create decks based around a shared colour identity. The shared identity does not have to completely match, as long as the colours are included.

Once all players have created decks, any cards that are present in more than one deck are removed from all decks. Cards that are removed this way _cannot_ be added back.
- The shared colour identity is chosen either at random or by vote. 
- The shared colour identity must be present in the commander identity.
  - The colours can be a subset - for example, if the shared colour identity is RW, then any commander must *at least* include RW, but can include more.
- There are exemptions to cards being duplicates. 
  - Commanders are exempt from being removed due to duplication.
  - All basic lands are exempt.
  - All non-basic, non-legendary lands are exempt.
  - Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, all 'Talisman of' Artifacts and all 'Signet' Artifacts are exempt.

### Land Ahoy

All players must have a minimum of fifty lands.

### Every Colour of the Rainbow

All commanders must be of WUBRG colour identity. No WUBRG cards can be played. 
- Cards can have up to four colours, but no more.

### Land Recession

All players are allowed up to twenty lands.
- A player may skip their turn to search their library for any basic land, which they can place on the battlefield untapped.
- Players may search their library for a basic land to put into their opening hand if they have less than seven cards, and do not already have a land in their hand.

### Keep It Simple, Stupid

Each player must play a unique mono-colour identity commander.
- Each commander must be a different colour.
- Each player gets their colour assigned _at random_.
- If more than five players wish to play, there can be duplicated colour identities.

A better way to explain is that if there are five players, one must play W, one must play B, one must play R, etc.

If there are six players, the above rule applies, except two players may share the same colour identity.

### The Lower Class

Each deck must be built with only cards of EDHRec ranking 50% or below. 
- Cards printed in 2025 are not allowed.
